### Get values of CSS properties
This script goes through every DOM element and returns the values of CSS properties and counts how many times they are being used. Execute this script in the developer console and it will return the object with values. To specify which properties to look for change the parameter of a self-invoking function(it could be either array of properties or a string with one property).
